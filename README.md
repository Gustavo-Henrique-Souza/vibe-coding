# Enduro Game Clone

This is a simple HTML5 Canvas implementation of the classic Atari game Enduro. The original game was released in 1983 for the Atari 2600 and featured a race car driving on an endless road, passing other vehicles.

## Game Features

- Canvas-based rendering
- Keyboard controls for driving
- Passing cars to score points
- Collision detection
- Simple physics (acceleration and deceleration)
- Visual elements like mountains, sky, and road

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click the "Start Game" button
3. Use the following controls:
   - Left Arrow: Move Left
   - Right Arrow: Move Right
   - Up Arrow: Accelerate (release to decelerate)
4. Avoid colliding with other cars
5. Pass as many cars as possible to increase your score

## Implementation Details

The game uses vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas with no external dependencies. Key features of the implementation include:

- Game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- Object-oriented design for cars and road
- Pseudo-3D effect for the road using perspective
- Simple collision detection
- Day/night cycle (coming in future versions)
- Weather changes (coming in future versions)

## Future Enhancements

- Add day/night cycle like in the original game
- Add weather conditions (fog, snow)
- Implement more challenging AI for opponent cars
- Add sound effects and music
- Mobile touch controls
